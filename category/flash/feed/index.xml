<p>Space Invaders is a fixed shooter game where the player dodges alien fires while attempting to destroy the in invading aliens. This version was written in Adobe Flash. Adobe Flash has been removed from all modern browsers. However, a flash player emulator written in the Rust programming language is available. Web assemble has been loaded so that you can enjoy this <a href="https://www.jstrgames.com/games/invaders.html">classic flash game</a>. Enjoy.</p>

<p>Pac-Man doesn&#8217;t need any introduction &#8211; I may be aging myself. It is a maze game where the character must eat all the pellets inside an enclosed maze while avoiding ghosts. This was one of the first game I was introduced to on the Atari console as a child. This version was written in Adobe Flash. Adobe Flash has been removed from all modern browsers. However, a flash player emulator written in the Rust programming language is available. Web assemble has been loaded so that you can enjoy this <a href="https://www.jstrgames.com/games/pacman.html">classic flash game</a>. Enjoy.</p>



<p>P.S. I did not create this game. I found it in the back up of my old website. </p>
