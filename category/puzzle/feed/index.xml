<p>Oops, I did it again. This game was inspired by both <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a> and the classic crossword puzzle. Guess the 8-letter (Octo) word of the day. Just like Wordle, you have 6 tries. However, like classic crossword puzzle, you have the help of the clue. Try to guess it on the first try or play like Wordle and eliminate letters to help identify the word of the day.</p>

<p>This game was inspired by the <a href="https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/">Wordle</a>. Wordle is daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle, hence the name Wordle. You can read about his story on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html">New York Times</a>. I thought about calling my version, WordRa, but that was borderline silly. With Wordle, I look forward to the daily word but wanted something similar to occupied my time.</p>



<p>I created <a href="https://wordhex.jstrgames.com/">WordHéx </a>over the weekend. It has the same rules as Wordle. The only difference it that it&#8217;s 6-letter word, hence the suffix &#8220;héx&#8221; &#8211; six. I hope Josh finds my imitation as flattery. </p>
